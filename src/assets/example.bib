  abstract = {After the Notre-Dame de Paris (NDP) Cathedral fire, a structural analysis was undertaken to provide decision support for architects in charge of diagnosis and repair operations. Due to the potential impact of the results on the renovation project, calculations on the vaults and walls of the monument were compared to increase their reliability. This article presents the 3 modelling strategies implemented: 2 discrete block-to-block 3D approaches (DEM and FEM) and 1 continuum 3D approach (FEM). The assumptions common to the 3 approaches are presented. They mainly concern the geometrical model, the thermal actions and a diagnosis methodology called the working point method, previously used by the authors on other Gothic vaults. Comparisons of the results with each other and with on-site deflection measurements should lead to validation of the calculation strategies. The analysis will highlight the strengths and weaknesses of the computational approaches and propose research perspectives. Future developments concern the determination of models of homogenized thermomechanical behaviour of masonry and the development of a new hybrid calculation tool taking advantage of the continuum and discontinuum approaches detailed in this article.},

  abstract = {April 15th, 2019: Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris was burning, the spire collapsed on the nave, vaults crumbled and most of the timber roof was gone. In the post-disaster context, the authenticity and the monitoring of the archaeological remains are crucial for their potential reuse during reconstruction. This paper analyzes the collapsed transverse arch from the nave of Notre-Dame as a case study of reconstruction, using the digital twin framework. We propose four facets for the digital twin experiment---physical anastylosis, reverse engineering, spatio-temporal tracking of assets, and operational research---that are described in detail, while being assembled to support a hybrid reconstruction hypothesis. The digital twin can realize the parallel unfolding of physical-native and digital-native processes, while acquiring and storing heterogeneous information as semantically structured data. The results demonstrate that the proposed modeling method facilitates the formalization and validation of the reconstruction problem and increases solutions performances. As result, we present a digital twin framework application ranging from acquisition to data processing that informs a successful hybrid reconstruction hypothesis.},

  abstract = {Despite their aesthetic expressivity, realistic images of reconstructed pasts tend to withhold the scientific work of reconstruction and fail to provide scholarly reusable documentation. The contribution examines the operative role of (3D-)representations in the context of archaeological reconstruction. We propose a semiotic framework to look at reconstruction images. A semiotics' analysis (aesthetic, technical and analytical attributes) of practical examples of reconstruction images from the Notre-Dame de Paris arch reconstruction shows that there is a double effect of compression in the reconstruction and its representation. To alleviate these compressions in discourse and meaning, we focus our effort on the argumentation patterns and the conflict of interpretations as foundations of reconstruction scholarship. If we consider the 3D-reconstruction not in its illustrative image of reconstruction, it becomes an inherent part of the reconstruction data. We demonstrate how the argumentation can tie together the visualizations and the reconstruction. The linking of representation and reconstruction is possible through consistent documentation practice using CIDOC CRMinf to elicit the reasoning and the argumentation in the reconstruction process.}
