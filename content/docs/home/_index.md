## Welcome to OMP

OMP is a collaborative repository for curation, publication and promotion of modelling patterns for scientific structured data.

Modelling patterns are schematic templates applicable for knowledge graphs, finely tuned for semantic web applications.

The scope of the registered modelling patterd spread through Digital Humanities, Scientific activities for conservation and monitoring of heritage buildings and built works. These patterns cover entities (actors, events, human-made objects), relationships between entities and with external thesauruses.

A shared data structure using pattern-based modelling makes it easier to design your knowledge base and get the maximum of flexibility and expressivity from the resulting graph.

You might want to get started with the Documentation, or dive directly in the registered Ontological Modelling Patterns.
