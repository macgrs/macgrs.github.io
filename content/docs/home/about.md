The collaborative creation of this repository stems from the mixed usage of the similar patterns for different scientific projects. And from the shared observation that, despite the profusion of: data policies, strong incentives, pertinent technologies, white papers, ontology-definition rules... the mediation of knowledge graph design methods is seldom seen.

Authorship of the patterns and their versionning is maintained in the related [Github](https://github.com/macgrs/macgrs.github.io) repository. This website is powered by Github-Pages and the [Hugo web framework](https://gohugo.io/).

The registered patterns are used for the following scientific projects :
+ [**REPERAGE Project**](http://www.sciences-patrimoine.org/projet/reperage/) : 
+ **ASTRAGALE Project** :


And beneffited from the expertises of the laboratories :
+ (UMR 3495 CNRS/MC) MAP - Models and Simulations for Heritage and Architecture
+ LRMH - Laboratory of Research of Historical Buildings
