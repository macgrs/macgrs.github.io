### Pattern-oriented modelling
Pattern-oriented ontological modelling is a bottom-up approach to define a knowledge graph directly from the data and its related activities. It aims to :
+ structure the data by explicit semantics ;
+ link and place data and the metadata at the same level ;
+ favorise linkage to related data, even if it is still not yet known.

A modelling pattern is designed from existing conceptual layers, such as semantic web ontologies. While an ontology is a conceptual model, a pattern is the instanciation of a data-structure from one or several ontologies. In such a way, modification of existing ontologies is highly-discouraged in favor to *soft*-extensions such as type-specification via a thesauruses and the use of base/core ontologies with a high-level of abstraction.
